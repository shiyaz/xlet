# xlet

## Let binding using Scala-like pattern extraction.


## Usage

The ``xlet`` macro creates a lexical context by first matching a
binding pattern against an expression and then binding the symbols in
the pattern to values extracted from the expression similar to the
pattern extraction mechanism in Scala.

The symbol ``_`` is used as a wildcard that is not bound. It is used
to ignore the corresponding value in the extraction.

The expression used for extraction must evaluate to a type that
extends the protocol ``IExtractPattern``.

### Example:

    (extend-type java.net.URL
            atollier.xlet/IExtractPattern
            (unapply [in]
              [(.getProtocol in) (.getHost in) (.getPort in) (.getPath in)]))

    (atollier.xlet/xlet (java.net.URL. "http://www.google.com/")
            ["https" host _ _] (str "HTTPS " host)
            ["http"  host _ _] (str "HTTP " host))

    (extend-type java.util.Date
        atollier.xlet/IExtractPattern
        (unapply [in]
            [(.getYear in) (.getMonth in) (.getDate in)]))

    (atollier.xlet/xlet (java.util.Date. 2016 2 6)
        [_ _ _ d] (throw (Exception. "Won't be thrown."))
        [_ _ d] (str "Day of month: " d))
